# **About Me**

Hey there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at PES University, and am in my exploratory era on the technical front!

Presently, I am nurturing my interest in domains including but not limited to operating systems, networking and IoT! Given a choice, I prefer hands-on experiences with projects over textbook-learning. 

I enjoy public speaking, debating, writing poetry, cooking, and trying new things! 

I am very strongly motivated to help the underprivileged reach their full potential, and hope to use my technical acumen to turn this goal into a reality!
