description:  A smart recipe assistant that can suggest recipes using images of your fridge's contents, preserve indigenous recipes by recommending regional, 
              lesser-known dishes within user groups with similar "tastes" (pun intended) and guide users step-by-step through cooking via an interactive chatbot.
