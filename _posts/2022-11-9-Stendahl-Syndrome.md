This summer break, after a grueling two years of eleventh and twelfth grade, my
family and I took a trip to the quiet and picturesque town of Leh, now located in
the new jurisdiction of the union territory, Ladakh.

A hiatus from the bustling city of Bengaluru was more than welcome for everyone.
The quaint little town, with cozy houses, small shops and peaceful monasteries in
contrast to the towering mountains and magnetite hills that surrounded it, made
Leh one of the most beautiful towns I have ever visited.

One of the most popular sightseeing destinations around Leh is the Pangong Lake,
which is where the last scene of the famous Amir Khan movie ‘3 Idiots’ was shot,
wherein the true identity of Phunsukh Wangdu was revealed.
Being fans of this movie, my family and I, like other tourists, drove 223 kilometers
from Leh, through roads that were as smooth as butter, to roads which were, well,
barely paths, let alone roads.

After a tiring six hours and backs that needed some serious massaging, we caught
our first glimpse of the breath-taking (literally, because the air was thin and
freezing) lake of Pangong. The bright teal color of the water in contrast to the
brown and gray mountains in the background truly brought out the best of nature’s
creation. The breeze created waves in the water that gently lapped against the small
pebbles and rocks near the lakeshore, giving rise to sounds which would be music
to a keen ear.

Wanting to get away from noisy tourists and crowds, my family and I walked
towards a quiet and secluded area on the lakeshore. Suddenly, I had to stop. My
knees felt weak and out of nowhere, I felt a sudden wave of emotions sweep my
mind, ones which I couldn’t recognise, but ones which I knew were overwhelming
me to the point where I just had to sit down for a moment. After a few seconds, I
felt my cheeks getting hot, being swept with tears. I was crying, and I hadn’t even
realized it. Then it struck me. My feelings were a confluence of happiness,
gratitude, sadness, hope and a longing to once again meet loved ones who were far
out of my reach in this lifetime, just like the confluence of the beauty of the lake,
the quiet dusk setting over the mountains, the sound of the waves lapping against
the shore made this place the majestic beauty that it is.

As I soaked in the view while listening more intently to the sounds around me, I
could sense each of these feelings getting stronger, and my cheeks getting wetter.
As a child, I saw waves as movements of water that just went back and forth from
its parent water body, but there on that lakeshore, I saw these waves as symbols
that signified time, exposing the rock and pebbles underneath like the obstacles we
face in life, but which are soon swept over by a new wave, sometimes taking them
away into the depths of the water, just like how new people and experiences make
handling our past a little easier, even if it isn’t completely erased.
Waves always move in the forward direction, their speed dependent on the strength
of the wind, their destination of the ocean predetermined, never letting anything get
in the way. My mind correlated this to the fact that we must always look ahead in
life, the wind being our willpower to do so, and our destinations being the ones we
each choose.

This calm and serene atmosphere induced strong feelings of gratitude, ones which
told me that I should be thankful that I have been given a life of physical, mental
and materialistic comfort, when I could have easily been born as fish in the lake
that was just a few feet from me, proving that my existence as a human being on
this Earth is not to just live for myself, but instead proving that I was born for a
larger and greater purpose.

Simultaneously, I felt a deep sense of melancholy, for I missed my departed aunt, a
source of unending joy and laughter, one who was the glue that held the family
together in my opinion. But there in that lake, I could feel her presence. As ironic
as it may seem, the cool breeze that crossed my face, reminded me of the sweet and
gentle caress of her warm hands.
I then felt two hands wrap around me. It was my mother. Noticing that I had fallen
behind, she had come looking for me, but did not ask any questions when she saw
my puffed up face. She just held me tight, making me cry more, as though she was
squeezing out all the emotions that were bottled up inside me.
As my tears began to reduce to a trickle, so did the gush of several emotions.
Later I realized that I had experienced ‘Stendhal Syndrome’, a psychosomatic
condition that causes physical changes to occur when a person is subjected to
scenes of immense beauty. Although, my ‘symptoms’ were not as severe,
thankfully!

This was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I sincerely hope that everyone
gets to experience it at some point in time. Even if you don’t, just realizing that
everything, both good and bad, is impermanent, and understanding that being
grateful everyday for the littlest of things can bring us unequaled joy which can
enable us to see life’s many aspects from a rational perspective, is more than
enough!
