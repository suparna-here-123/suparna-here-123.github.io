My mother has been through thick and thin<br>
But her strength always helped keep up her chin<br>

Some may say that life is unfair,<br>
But from my mother, I have learned to be brave<br>

She says I brought her joy and happiness,<br>
Although I’d say I’m a bit of a mess!<br>

Packing my lunch, combing my hair,<br>
Tying my shoelace and walking down the stairs<br>

From the bus stop she waves to me, “bye!”,<br>
And then I’m all set for the ride<br>

The warmth of her hug radiates a new hope,<br>
To courageously climb any of life’s slopes<br>

Her loving hands give me a caress,<br>
Which instantly relieves any stress<br>

In a race, she is always my cheerleader,<br>
But if I lose, the supporting shoulder<br>

Her sacrifices can never be counted,<br>
And I may never surmount them.<br>

She shares my joy and melancholy,<br>
But I can handle both with her strength solely<br>

No matter the number of tiffs,<br>
We always come back in a jiff<br>

One day when I am strong and brave,<br>
It will be from all my mother gave...<br>
