description: An ode to my best friend (and parent :D)

My mother has been through thick and thin
But her strength always helped keep up her chin

Some may say that life is unfair,
But from my mother, I have learned to be brave

She says I brought her joy and happiness,
Although I’d say I’m a bit of a mess!

Packing my lunch, combing my hair,
Tying my shoelace and walking down the stairs

From the bus stop she waves to me, “bye!”,
And then I’m all set for the ride

The warmth of her hug radiates a new hope,
To courageously climb any of life’s slopes

Her loving hands give me a caress,
Which instantly relieves any stress

In a race, she is always my cheerleader,
But if I lose, the supporting shoulder

Her sacrifices can never be counted,
And I may never surmount them.

She shares my joy and melancholy,
But I can handle both with her strength solely

No matter the number of tiffs,
We always come back in a jiff

One day when I am strong and brave,
It will be from all my mother gave...
