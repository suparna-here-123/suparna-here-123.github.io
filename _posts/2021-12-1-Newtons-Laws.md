Sir Isaac Newton, was a great physicist and mathematician,
whose groundbreaking works have laid a strong foundation.
Among them are the Universal Law of Gravitation, and Calculus
Which in turn have spawned newer discoveries in surplus.

With seminal contributions in Astronomy and Optics,
He is also known as the Father of Mechanics
To science he has made many a contribution
Of which the most well-known are his Laws of Motion

## First law – An object persists in its state of rest/motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force.

A rolling football comes to rest completely,
only when stopped by friction or a goalie!
But it rolls faster if kicked with more energy,
as in a football match with Lionel Messi!

## Second law – The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to its mass.

A lorry and a car with equal accelerations on a highway,
Are both low on gas, and need to stop for fuel midway
Working harder than the car’s brakes are the truck’s
As mass of a body in the equation F = ma, is at the crux.

## Third Law – Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force.

An example from our daily activities would be walking,
Which is a great way for all of us to be exercising!
While doing so, our forefoot exerts a force on a hard flooring,
And the floor pushes us back with an equal force, which helps us get going!

These 3 gems formed the basis of Classical Mechanics,
Which later led to great research in Quantum Mechanics
To me, a celebrated scientist like Sir Isaac Newton
will always remain a great inspiration!
