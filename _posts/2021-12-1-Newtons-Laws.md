Sir Isaac Newton, was a great physicist and mathematician,<br>
whose groundbreaking works have laid a strong foundation.<br>
Among them are the Universal Law of Gravitation, and Calculus<br>
Which in turn have spawned newer discoveries in surplus.<br>

With seminal contributions in Astronomy and Optics,<br>
He is also known as the Father of Mechanics<br>
To science he has made many a contribution<br>
Of which the most well-known are his Laws of Motion<br>

A rolling football comes to rest completely,<br>
only when stopped by friction or a goalie!<br>
But it rolls faster if kicked with more energy,<br>
as in a football match with Lionel Messi!<br>

A lorry and a car with equal accelerations on a highway,<br>
Are both low on gas, and need to stop for fuel midway<br>
Working harder than the car’s brakes are the truck’s<br>
As mass of a body in the equation F = ma, is at the crux.<br>

An example from our daily activities would be walking,<br>
Which is a great way for all of us to be exercising!<br>
While doing so, our forefoot exerts a force on a hard flooring,<br>
And the floor pushes us back with an equal force, which helps us get going!<br>

These 3 gems formed the basis of Classical Mechanics,<br>
Which later led to great research in Quantum Mechanics<br>
To me, a celebrated scientist like Sir Isaac Newton<br>
will always remain a great inspiration!<br>
