description: Tough times colour our outlook to life with a nihilistic shade. But only faith can remove this curtain of pessimsim.

“What difference is a new day,
When all my mind’s in an affray
This could never ever possibly pass,
As fast as sand may trickle down the hourglass.”

“Don’t want to wake up, or make my bed,
Just lay there until quiet become the demons in my head
The light of the day has become blinding,
Only the darkness of the night, calming.”

Tough times test your faith, they say,
And that I get through it, is all I pray
Theism or atheism, you make the choice,
But in hard times, only faith maintains poise.

And no, faith is not found only in an idol,
It could be in a tree, a rock, or a parent’s cuddle
Slowly, a weight lifts off your shoulders,
And to say “The cosmos’ll handle it”, makes me bolder.
