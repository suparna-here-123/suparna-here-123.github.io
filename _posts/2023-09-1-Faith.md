description: Tough times colour our outlook to life with a nihilistic shade. But only faith can remove this curtain of pessimsim.

“What difference is a new day,<br>
When all my mind’s in an affray<br>
This could never ever possibly pass,<br>
As fast as sand may trickle down the hourglass.”<br>

“Don’t want to wake up, or make my bed,<br>
Just lay there until quiet become the demons in my head<br>
The light of the day has become blinding,<br>
Only the darkness of the night, calming.”<br>

Tough times test your faith, they say,<br>
And that I get through it, is all I pray<br>
Theism or atheism, you make the choice,<br>
But in hard times, only faith maintains poise.<br>

And no, faith is not found only in an idol,<br>
It could be in a tree, a rock, or a parent’s cuddle<br>
Slowly, a weight lifts off your shoulders,<br>
And to say “The cosmos’ll handle it”, makes me bolder.<br>
