“Today brings a new day, that opens a new chapter,
with new friends, and hopefully a day full of banter!”
Brimming with excitement tinged with nervousness,
he stepped foot into the campus’ sprawling vastness

Lost and confused in the hallways, was he found
By a friendly senior, who said – “Let me show you around!”
Relieved, he unquestioningly followed his newfound compass,
Finally arriving at the boys’ hostel on campus.

A gang of brawny boys awaited them inside,
with scruffy beards and chests puffed full of pride.
“Now, you must repay me for all my kindness,
So do as we say – you can only say “Yes.””

Like a ringmaster commanding his circus troupe,
Each boy gave him demeaning tasks, such that no lower could they stoop.
Their whistles, claps and guffaws created a raucous,
with the cornered and terrified boy at the focus.

As hot tears of humiliation trickled down his cheek,
the helpless boy followed all commands, that soon made him weak.
After what seemed like forever, he was let go,
While the skies had sunk into darkness, so had his ego.

Greeted by a warm “How was your day, sweetie?”,
he rushed into his mother’s arms, holding her tightly.
Traumatised, with a mind shattered like broken glass,
he wept and narrated to her all that had come to pass.

Soon subjected to severe repercussions, every single perpetrator
apologised to the boy – but none healed his psyche by any factor.
Bit-by-bit, day-by-day, he revived his broken spirit,
in turn giving birth to newfound strength and grit.

We are the sole owners of our dignity,
And to rob another of theirs is a felony.
So before going on a ragging spree,
Ask yourself, “What if that were me?”
