“Today brings a new day, that opens a new chapter,<br>
with new friends, and hopefully a day full of banter!”<br>
Brimming with excitement tinged with nervousness,<br>
he stepped foot into the campus’ sprawling vastness<br>

Lost and confused in the hallways, was he found<br>
By a friendly senior, who said – “Let me show you around!”<br>
Relieved, he unquestioningly followed his newfound compass,<br>
Finally arriving at the boys’ hostel on campus.<br>

A gang of brawny boys awaited them inside,<br>
with scruffy beards and chests puffed full of pride.<br>
“Now, you must repay me for all my kindness,<br>
So do as we say – you can only say “Yes.””<br>

Like a ringmaster commanding his circus troupe,<br>
Each boy gave him demeaning tasks, such that no lower could they stoop.<br>
Their whistles, claps and guffaws created a raucous,<br>
with the cornered and terrified boy at the focus.<br>

As hot tears of humiliation trickled down his cheek,<br>
the helpless boy followed all commands, that soon made him weak.<br>
After what seemed like forever, he was let go,<br>
While the skies had sunk into darkness, so had his ego.<br>

Greeted by a warm “How was your day, sweetie?”,<br>
he rushed into his mother’s arms, holding her tightly.<br>
Traumatised, with a mind shattered like broken glass,<br>
he wept and narrated to her all that had come to pass.<br>

Soon subjected to severe repercussions, every single perpetrator<br>
apologised to the boy – but none healed his psyche by any factor.<br>
Bit-by-bit, day-by-day, he revived his broken spirit,<br>
in turn giving birth to newfound strength and grit.<br>

We are the sole owners of our dignity,<br>
And to rob another of theirs is a felony.<br>
So before going on a ragging spree,<br>
Ask yourself, “What if that were me?”<br>
