description: Self love should be everyone's top priority. Everyone goes through feelings of insecurity, inferiority - but we can't let them get the better of us. Here's a short poem I wrote as part of a contest in a duration of 1 hour!

I’ve had 17 years of life, there’s still a long way to go,
Although, there have been many highs and lows
A myriad of feelings between insecurity and confidence,
Sometimes all at the same time, in confluence

I used to only always hear my mirror tell me,
“You have too long a nose and ugly acne,
Your hair is too straight, you look too fat,
Nothing you do can ever change any of that”

I used to compare, cry, fret and whine,
That never like a celebrity did I shine
But time has taught me so much more,
Looks aren’t everything, and I too have talents galore

That “ugly acne” does indeed fade,
Inferior emotions are all pushed into the shade
If only I could tell myself long long before,
Don’t worry so much, else life seems like a chore

Now, I celebrate myself, my soul, my being,
Facades of my personality just needed some preening
Confident, Determined and beautiful,
That’s just me, I will never be doubtful...
