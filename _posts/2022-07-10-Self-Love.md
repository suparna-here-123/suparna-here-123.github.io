description: Self love should be everyone's top priority. Everyone goes through feelings of insecurity, inferiority - but we can't let them get the better of us. Here's a short poem I wrote as part of a contest in a duration of 1 hour!

I’ve had 17 years of life, there’s still a long way to go,<br>
Although, there have been many highs and lows<br>
A myriad of feelings between insecurity and confidence,<br>
Sometimes all at the same time, in confluence<br>

I used to only always hear my mirror tell me,<br>
“You have too long a nose and ugly acne,<br>
Your hair is too straight, you look too fat,<br>
Nothing you do can ever change any of that”<br>

I used to compare, cry, fret and whine,<br>
That never like a celebrity did I shine<br>
But time has taught me so much more,<br>
Looks aren’t everything, and I too have talents galore<br>

That “ugly acne” does indeed fade,<br>
Inferior emotions are all pushed into the shade<br>
If only I could tell myself long long before,<br>
Don’t worry so much, else life seems like a chore<br>

Now, I celebrate myself, my soul, my being,<br>
Facades of my personality just needed some preening<br>
Confident, Determined and beautiful,<br>
That’s just me, I will never be doubtful...<br>
